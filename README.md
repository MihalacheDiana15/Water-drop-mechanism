# Water-drop-mechanism
The mechanism simulates the waves made by a drop when it hits a body of water.

I chose to realize this project, applying what I learned this semester, because I found it interesting how we can simulate a basic phenomenon in a creative way.
The mechanism simulates the waves made by a drop when it hits a body of water, being easy to understand from the tracking of the gif. By the rotational movement made by the axe, the rings simulate the shape of waves.

To design and render I used Fusion 360.
Also, the components are made so that they can be printed.

Components:
Holder
Axe&disks
Handle
6 rings

Joints:
revolut axe-holder
rigid axe-handle
slider rings
contact set rings-disks

File types: .stl, .f3d, .jpeg, .mp4, .gif
